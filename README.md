# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Description

This project is about creating an application that a user can operate to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying a starter code on JavaScript.

My application should have the following requirements:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked.
  * Present a prompt for these password criteria:
    * Length of password:
      * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    * Character types:
      * Lowercase.
      * Uppercase.
      * Numeric.
      * Special characters.
  * My code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected.
  * Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page


This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. Also it should have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Installation

Clone the project and open it using your favourite browser (I recommend using Chrome).

## Usage

My web application should resemble this following image in appareance and funcionality, although I had fun adding a little bit of colour.
